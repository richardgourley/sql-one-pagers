# SQL One Pagers

## INTRO
This is a one page reference for the most common SQL Data Query Language queries. 

This repo is only focussed on data query language. See 'Related' to setup the server and download sample databases you can work with.

## CONTENTS
**sql-dql-queries.ipynb**
- This file has 11 sections of the most common SQL DQL query examples in one page with query explanations and notes.

- This file has the same 11 sections of queries just without any notes for quick syntax checking.

**sql-dql-queries-test-yourself.ipynb**
- This file is a list of simple tests to help users remember all of the example queries from each topic.
- If you can confidently write out query examples for every section, then you're on your way to mastering querying in SQL.

## GETTING STARTED
- The examples are a mix of my own and examples from online SQL Server tutorials.
- If you are learning or working on PostgreSQL or MySQL, the 'sql-dql-queries-test-yourself' file is still useful for checking gaps in your knowledge. The 'sql-dql-queries page is also a useful reference even though the syntax will be different in some parts.
