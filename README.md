# SQL One Pagers

## INTRO
This is a one page reference for the most common SQL Data Query Language queries. 

I've found it to be a useful SQL reference I check now and again in writing SQL queries.

This is a reference guide I have compiled for SQL users to find all of the most common DQL queries in one place for easy access.

## CONTENTS
**sql-dql-queries.ipynb**
- This file has 11 sections of the most common SQL DQL query examples.
- Clear notes and query aims are added to each query.

**sql-dql-queries-syntax-only.ipynb**
- This file has all of the same query examples just without any notes for a quick syntax check.

**sql-dql-queries-test-yourself.ipynb**
- This file is a list of simple tests to help users remember all of the example queries from each topic.
- If you can confidently write out query examples for every section, then you're on your way to mastering querying in SQL.

## GETTING STARTED
- The examples are a mix of my own and examples from online SQL Server tutorials.
- Postgres and MySQL and SQL in general share many of the topics. Even though the syntax is slightly different and the database tables used in online tutorials may differ, the test-yourself file could be useful in checking any gaps in your knowledge.

- If you already use SQL, or are learning SQL, then I recommend checking the syntax-only file followed by the test-yourself file before referring to the queries file to check any notes.
- If you are new to SQL, I recommend learning from one of the links in the RELATED section below first.  These one page guides are based on example queries rather than giving information about the database tables behind the queries.
