# SQL Data Query Language Queries - Test Yourself
- The tests in this page are all based on the 'sql-dql-queries.ipynb' file queries.
- The tests are to make sure you can remember query syntax but it is really important to also understand the queries in depth before trying the tests. Check the query aims and notes in the 'sql-dql-queries.ipynb' file as required.

# 1. Query Order
**TEST:**
- Write the order SQL performs queries in by keyword, eg. FROM, WHERE, SELECT etc.

# 2. Sorting

**ORDER BY:**

a. Write a query to retrieving all first names from a CUSTOMERS table, ordered by first name in descending order.

b. Write a query to retrieve all first names and cities from a CUSTOMERS table, ordering first by city and then by first name, alphabetically.

c. Write a query to retrieve all first names from a CUSTOMERS table, ordering the first names by length, starting with the shortest name first.
