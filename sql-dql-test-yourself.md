# SQL Data Query Language Queries - Test Yourself
- The tests in this page are all based on the 'sql-dql-queries.ipynb' file queries.
- The tests are to make sure you can remember query syntax but it is really important to also understand the queries in depth before trying the tests. Check the query aims and notes in the 'sql-dql-queries.ipynb' file.

# 1. Query Order
- Write the order SQL performs queries in by keyword, eg. FROM, WHERE, SELECT etc.

# 2. Sorting

## 2a. Order By

1. Write a query to retrieve all first names from a table using ORDER BY to order the names alphabetically.

2. Write a query to retrieve first names and city from a table, using ORDER BY to order first by city and then by first name.

3. Write a query to retrieve all first names from a table, using ORDER BY to order the first names by length, starting with the shortest name first.

# 3. Limiting

## 3a. Offset Fetch

1. Write a query to retrieve team name and points then using ORDER BY points to order the results. Then limit the query to skip the first 4 rows and only retrieve the next 13 rows after that.

2. Write the first part of a query (the SELECT part) to retrieve the first 10 results.

3. Write the first part of a query (the SELECT part) to retrieve the top 1 percent of results

4. Write the first part of a query (the SELECT part) to retrieve the top 3 results with ties (any results that are equal third)
